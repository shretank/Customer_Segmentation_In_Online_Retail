PROJECT 1: Customer Segmentation in online retail

So, I did my project that is customer segmentation in online retail...
the main objective of the project is to perform custom segmentation for an online retail business. Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into distinct group based on shared characteristics, behaviour or preferences. by effectively segmenting customers, businesses can gain valuable insights and tailor marketing strategies to specific customer group, leading to improved customer satisfaction and increased profitability.
In today’s era, companies work hard to make their customers happy. They launch new technologies and services so that customers can use their products more. They try to be in touch with each of their customers so that they can provide goods accordingly. But practically, it’s very difficult and non-realistic to keep in touch with everyone. So, here comes the usage of Customer Segmentation.

Customer Segmentation means the segmentation of customers on the basis of their similar characteristics, behaviour, and needs. This will eventually help the company in many ways. Like, they can launch the product or enhance the features accordingly. They can also target a particular sector as per their behaviours. All of these lead to an enhancement in the overall market value of the company.

Customer Segmentation in Online Retail – Project Overview
Goal: The project aimed to analyze customer spending habits and group customers into distinct clusters using unsupervised learning techniques. The insights from clustering were used to propose actionable business strategies for each customer segment.
Step-by-Step Process:
1. Data Collection:
•	Data Source: The dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing transactional data for online retail customers. It included information such as customer IDs, purchase dates, product details, quantity, and total expenditure.
2. Data Cleaning:
•	Handling Null Values: Missing customer IDs and transaction details were removed to maintain data quality.
•	Removing Duplicates: Duplicate records were eliminated to prevent bias or redundancy in the analysis.
•	Handling Outliers: Outliers in monetary and quantity values were identified using z-scores or IQR and handled appropriately.
3. Feature Exploration:
•	Understanding Customer Behavior: Key features like purchase quantity, transaction frequency, and monetary value were explored. Initial analysis provided an overview of the customer distribution and sales trends.
4. Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Analysis:
•	Recency (R): Measures how recently a customer made a purchase. Recent purchases imply a higher likelihood of engagement.
•	Frequency (F): Indicates how often a customer makes purchases. Frequent purchases suggest loyalty.
•	Monetary Value (M): Represents the total spending of a customer. Higher spending often correlates with high-value customers.
The dataset was transformed to calculate these three dimensions (RFM) for each customer.
5. Data Transformation (Log Transform):
•	Skewness Removal: Since the distribution of RFM data was likely skewed (with most customers purchasing infrequently and a few making many high-value purchases), log transformation was applied to normalize the data. This ensured that the clustering algorithm would not be overly influenced by extreme values.
•	Use monthly purchase example most of the person having  monthly purchase of 20,000 and few have 20,000,00 so it will create a big diff and ML models may influence towards the big data which cause the randomness in our end results so we use log transform method as log(20,000) is comes out 4.3 and log(20,000,00) comes out 6.3 so our model now will not be influenced towards the big value because now value are not big in comparison.

6. Feature Scaling:
•	Standardization: Before applying the clustering algorithm, the data was standardized using a Standard Scaler to ensure all features contributed equally to the distance metrics. This step prevents features with larger numerical ranges from dominating the clustering process.
•	Standard Scaling ka main concept yeh hai ki data ko ek aise scale par laaya jaaye jahan har feature ka mean 0 aur standard deviation 1 ho. Iska matlab hai ki har feature (attribute) ko ek jaisa importance milta hai, chahe unki original range ya units alag-alag kyu na ho.
•	Standard Scaling kaise kaam karta hai:
•	Standard scaling, ek mathematical formula ke through kaam karta hai:
•	Z=(X−μ)σZ = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}Z=σ(X−μ)
•	X: Original value
•	μ (mean): Data ka average
•	σ (standard deviation): Data ki variability ya spread
•	Is formula ke through, hum har value ko scale karte hain. Har feature ke original values ko unki mean se subtract karte hain aur phir standard deviation se divide karte hain. Isse har feature ek standard range mein aa jaata hai, jisme mean = 0 aur standard deviation = 1 hota hai.
•	Standard Scale ka Real-Life Example:
•	Man lo ki tum ek bank ke liye kaam kar rahe ho jo loan approval ka decision lene ke liye machine learning model banata hai. Model mein alag-alag features hain jaise:
•	Income (e.g., ₹20,000 se ₹2,00,000 tak)
•	Credit Score (e.g., 300 se 850 tak)
•	Loan Amount (e.g., ₹50,000 se ₹10,00,000 tak)
•	Age (e.g., 18 se 65 years)
•	Problem:
•	Abhi, Income aur Loan Amount ke values bohot large range mein hain, aur Credit Score aur Age comparatively choti range mein. Agar tum scaling nahi karte, to Income aur Loan Amount ka zyada influence hoga model par kyunki unke values zyada bade hain, jabki Credit Score aur Age equally important hone ke baad bhi kam influence karenge.
•	Solution:
•	Standard Scaling ka use karke, tum har feature ko scale kar doge taki sabka mean 0 aur standard deviation 1 ho jaaye. Ab Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, aur Age sab ek jaisi scale par hain aur model unhe equally consider karega.
•	Kaise Apply Karte Hain:
•	Mean ko subtract karo: Har value se us feature ka mean subtract karo.
•	Standard deviation se divide karo: Phir result ko standard deviation se divide karo
•	Kya Hota Hai Standard Scaling ke Baad:
•	Sabhi features (jaise Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount) ek standard range mein aa jaate hain, aur model ko koi bhi ek feature zyada influence nahi karta.
•	Yeh scaling technique distance-based algorithms (jaise K-means clustering) ya gradient-based algorithms (jaise Logistic Regression) mein bohot zaroori hoti hai.
•	Is tarah se StandardScaler ensure karta hai ki saare features ka barabar importance ho, chahe unki original range ya units kuch bhi ho.
•	Jab tum Standard Scaling ka use karte ho, toh tum data ke har feature ko transform karte ho taki uska mean 0 aur standard deviation 1 ban jaaye. Is process ko achieve karne ke liye hum har feature ke values ko unke original scale se adjust karte hain.
•	Standard Scaling ka process:
•	Mean ko subtract karna (center the data):
•	Har feature ka mean calculate karo (i.e., sabhi values ka average nikalo).
•	Phir, us mean ko har individual data point se subtract karo. Isse tumhara data center ho jaata hai, yaani saare values ke aas paas ka average 0 ho jaata hai.
•	Standard Deviation se divide karna (normalize the data):
•	Har feature ka standard deviation calculate karo (jo data ki variability ko measure karta hai).
•	Phir, har data point ko us feature ke standard deviation se divide kar do. Isse tumhare data ki variability ek uniform scale mein aa jaati hai, jisme sabhi values ek similar range mein hoti hain, jahan standard deviation 1 hoti hai.
•	Formula:
•	Z=(X−μ)σZ = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}Z=σ(X−μ)
•	X: Original data value
•	μ (mean): Feature ka average value
•	σ (standard deviation): Feature ki spread ya variability
•	Example:
•	Suppose tumhare paas ek dataset hai jisme 2 features hain:
•	Income	•	Credit Score
•	50000	•	600
•	70000	•	750
•	90000	•	720
•	Step 1: Mean and Standard Deviation Calculate karo
•	Income:
•	Mean = (50000 + 70000 + 90000) / 3 = 70000
•	Standard Deviation = 20000
•	Credit Score:
•	Mean = (600 + 750 + 720) / 3 = 690
•	Standard Deviation = 75
•	Step 2: Standard Scaling Apply karo
•	Formula:
For each data point, new value Z=(X−μ)σZ = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}Z=σ(X−μ)
•	Income (Original)	•	Credit Score (Original)	•	Income (Scaled)	•	Credit Score (Scaled)
•	50000	•	600	•	(50000−70000)20000=−1.0\frac{(50000 - 70000)}{20000} = -1.020000(50000−70000)=−1.0	•	(600−690)75=−1.2\frac{(600 - 690)}{75} = -1.275(600−690)=−1.2
•	70000	•	750	•	(70000−70000)20000=0.0\frac{(70000 - 70000)}{20000} = 0.020000(70000−70000)=0.0	•	(750−690)75=0.8\frac{(750 - 690)}{75} = 0.875(750−690)=0.8
•	90000	•	720	•	(90000−70000)20000=1.0\frac{(90000 - 70000)}{20000} = 1.020000(90000−70000)=1.0	•	(720−690)75=0.4\frac{(720 - 690)}{75} = 0.475(720−690)=0.4
•	Output (Scaled Data):
•	Income (Scaled)	•	Credit Score (Scaled)
•	-1.0	•	-1.2
•	0.0	•	0.8
•	1.0	•	0.4
•	Kya Hota hai Scaling ke baad:
•	Income aur Credit Score dono ka mean 0 aur standard deviation 1 ho gaya.
•	Ab Income aur Credit Score dono ek uniform scale mein hain, jisse koi bhi feature model mein dominate nahi karega.
•	Scaling ke baad, har feature ka equal importance hota hai jab hum model train karte hain.
•	Is process ka fayda yeh hai ki ab tumhara model saare features ko barabar importance dega, chahe kisi feature ka range originally chhota ya bada kyu na ho



7. K-Means Clustering:
•	Choosing the Optimal Number of Clusters: The Elbow Method and Silhouette Score were used to determine the optimal number of clusters. This involves plotting the sum of squared distances for different values of K and identifying the point where the rate of decrease slows down (the "elbow").
•	Clustering: K-means clustering was then applied to segment customers based on their RFM scores. The algorithm assigned each customer to one of the clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance.
8. Customer Segments:
The clustering results revealed three distinct customer segments:
•	Major Customers: High RFM scores, representing the most valuable and frequent customers.
•	Average Customers: Moderate RFM scores, representing regular customers with average spending.
•	Churn Customers: Low RFM scores, representing customers who have either stopped purchasing or spend minimally.
9. Actionable Insights for Each Segment:
Based on the characteristics of each customer segment, business actions were proposed:
•	Major Customers:
o	Provide personalized discounts and offers to retain their loyalty.
o	Offer VIP services and exclusive early access to new products.
o	Implement loyalty programs to maintain engagement.
•	Average Customers:
o	Encourage more frequent purchases by offering limited-time discounts or promotional bundles.
o	Send personalized recommendations based on previous buying patterns.
o	Use targeted marketing to upsell and increase the monetary value of their purchases.
•	Churn Customers:
o	Reactivate customers by offering one-time discounts or special offers to bring them back.
o	Send re-engagement emails with personalized product recommendations or special deals.
o	Conduct surveys to understand why they have stopped purchasing and address their concerns.
10. Results and Conclusion:
