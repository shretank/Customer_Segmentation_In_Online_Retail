PROJECT 1: Customer Segmentation in online retail

So, I did my project that is customer segmentation in online retail...
the main objective of the project is to perform custom segmentation for an online retail business. Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into distinct group based on shared characteristics, behaviour or preferences. by effectively segmenting customers, businesses can gain valuable insights and tailor marketing strategies to specific customer group, leading to improved customer satisfaction and increased profitability.
In today’s era, companies work hard to make their customers happy. They launch new technologies and services so that customers can use their products more. They try to be in touch with each of their customers so that they can provide goods accordingly. But practically, it’s very difficult and non-realistic to keep in touch with everyone. So, here comes the usage of Customer Segmentation.

Customer Segmentation means the segmentation of customers on the basis of their similar characteristics, behaviour, and needs. This will eventually help the company in many ways. Like, they can launch the product or enhance the features accordingly. They can also target a particular sector as per their behaviours. All of these lead to an enhancement in the overall market value of the company.

Customer Segmentation in Online Retail – Project Overview
Goal: The project aimed to analyze customer spending habits and group customers into distinct clusters using unsupervised learning techniques. The insights from clustering were used to propose actionable business strategies for each customer segment.
Step-by-Step Process:
1. Data Collection:
•	Data Source: The dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing transactional data for online retail customers. It included information such as customer IDs, purchase dates, product details, quantity, and total expenditure.
2. Data Cleaning:
•	Handling Null Values: Missing customer IDs and transaction details were removed to maintain data quality.
•	Removing Duplicates: Duplicate records were eliminated to prevent bias or redundancy in the analysis.
•	Handling Outliers: Outliers in monetary and quantity values were identified using z-scores or IQR and handled appropriately.
3. Feature Exploration:
•	Understanding Customer Behavior: Key features like purchase quantity, transaction frequency, and monetary value were explored. Initial analysis provided an overview of the customer distribution and sales trends.
4. Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Analysis:
•	Recency (R): Measures how recently a customer made a purchase. Recent purchases imply a higher likelihood of engagement.
•	Frequency (F): Indicates how often a customer makes purchases. Frequent purchases suggest loyalty.
•	Monetary Value (M): Represents the total spending of a customer. Higher spending often correlates with high-value customers.
The dataset was transformed to calculate these three dimensions (RFM) for each customer.
5. Data Transformation (Log Transform):
•	Skewness Removal: Since the distribution of RFM data was likely skewed (with most customers purchasing infrequently and a few making many high-value purchases), log transformation was applied to normalize the data. This ensured that the clustering algorithm would not be overly influenced by extreme values.
•	Use monthly purchase example most of the person having  monthly purchase of 20,000 and few have 20,000,00 so it will create a big diff and ML models may influence towards the big data which cause the randomness in our end results so we use log transform method as log(20,000) is comes out 4.3 and log(20,000,00) comes out 6.3 so our model now will not be influenced towards the big value because now value are not big in comparison.

6. Feature Scaling:
•	Standardization: Before applying the clustering algorithm, the data was standardized using a Standard Scaler to ensure all features contributed equally to the distance metrics. This step prevents features with larger numerical ranges from dominating the clustering process.



7. K-Means Clustering:
•	Choosing the Optimal Number of Clusters: The Elbow Method and Silhouette Score were used to determine the optimal number of clusters. This involves plotting the sum of squared distances for different values of K and identifying the point where the rate of decrease slows down (the "elbow").
•	Clustering: K-means clustering was then applied to segment customers based on their RFM scores. The algorithm assigned each customer to one of the clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance.
8. Customer Segments:
The clustering results revealed three distinct customer segments:
•	Major Customers: High RFM scores, representing the most valuable and frequent customers.
•	Average Customers: Moderate RFM scores, representing regular customers with average spending.
•	Churn Customers: Low RFM scores, representing customers who have either stopped purchasing or spend minimally.
9. Actionable Insights for Each Segment:
Based on the characteristics of each customer segment, business actions were proposed:
•	Major Customers:
o	Provide personalized discounts and offers to retain their loyalty.
o	Offer VIP services and exclusive early access to new products.
o	Implement loyalty programs to maintain engagement.
•	Average Customers:
o	Encourage more frequent purchases by offering limited-time discounts or promotional bundles.
o	Send personalized recommendations based on previous buying patterns.
o	Use targeted marketing to upsell and increase the monetary value of their purchases.
•	Churn Customers:
o	Reactivate customers by offering one-time discounts or special offers to bring them back.
o	Send re-engagement emails with personalized product recommendations or special deals.
o	Conduct surveys to understand why they have stopped purchasing and address their concerns.
10. Results and Conclusion:
•	Clusters Identified: The project successfully grouped customers into three distinct segments.
•	Business Strategy: By understanding each segment's behavior, the company could allocate marketing resources more efficiently and implement customer-specific strategies to drive engagement and revenue growth.
Tools and Technologies Used:
•	Python & Jupyter Notebook: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
•	Pandas: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
•	Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering): For customer segmentation.
•	Data Analysis Techniques: Including RFM analysis and feature scaling.
